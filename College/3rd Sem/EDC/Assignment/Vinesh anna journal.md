### Introduction
In recent years, silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) power modules have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based power modules in various applications due to their superior switching speeds, more efficient thermal conductivity characteristics, higher maximum operating temperatures, and higher blocking voltage capabilities. However, the reliability of these power modules is a concern, and thermal modeling is a useful tool for predicting their reliability. A thermal model is a mathematical representation of the heat transfer behavior of a power module during its operation. 

In this paper, the authors propose a hybrid model order reduction method for automated extraction of low-order thermal models with controllable error bounds for SiC MOSFET power modules. The proposed method significantly reduces computation cost while preserving accuracy, making it a practical solution for real-time thermal management and control of power modules. The authors also conduct experimental tests to validate the proposed thermal modeling method. 

This paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a literature review of existing thermal modeling methods for power modules. Section III presents the proposed hybrid model order reduction method. Section IV describes the experimental validation of the proposed method. Section V discusses the results and analysis of the proposed method. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper and suggests future research directions.

### Proposed work
The proposed work in this paper is a hybrid model order reduction method for automated extraction of low-order thermal models with controllable error bounds for SiC MOSFET power modules. The authors use a finite element analysis (FEA) based full-order thermal model (FOM) to model the thermal process of a SiC MOSFET power module and then reduce the order of the FEA thermal model using a hybrid model order reduction method. The resulting reduced-order thermal model has a significantly reduced computation cost compared to the FEA model while preserving the accuracy of the FEA model with controllable error bounds. The proposed method is validated by computer simulation and experimental tests with respect to the FEA thermal model and is compared with a state-of-the-art three-dimensional thermal equivalent circuit model and the reduced-order thermal models generated by using a Krylov subspace projection method.

### Exisiting limitations
The existing limitations in the field of thermal modeling for power modules include the computational complexity of high-order state-space thermal models, especially those created using numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). These high-order models are accurate in representing the effects on heat transfer due to complex geometry and thermal coupling effects, but they are computationally complex and impractical for online or real-time implementation. Additionally, the computational complexity of some model order reduction (MOR) methods grows significantly as the original system order increases, making them inefficient for larger systems with high orders ,[object Object],.

Furthermore, traditional thermal modeling methods may not provide a balance between accuracy and computation cost, leading to challenges in real-time thermal management and control of power modules. These limitations highlight the need for advanced techniques that can reduce the order of thermal models while preserving accuracy and providing controllable error bounds, thus addressing the practical challenges associated with thermal modeling for power modules.

### Tools used
The tools used in the proposed work include:

1. Finite Element Analysis (FEA): FEA is utilized to create and extract a full-order thermal model (FOM) of the SiC MOSFET power module. FEA is a numerical method used to solve complex engineering problems by dividing the model into smaller, simpler elements for analysis.

2. Model Order Reduction (MOR) Methods: The proposed work employs a hybrid MOR method, which combines the advantages of Krylov subspace projection method and the controllable error bound of the Hankel singular value based MOR method. This allows for the reduction of the order of the FEA thermal model while preserving accuracy with controllable error bounds.

3. Computer Simulation: The proposed method is validated by computer simulation with respect to the FEA thermal model and is compared with a state-of-the-art three-dimensional thermal equivalent circuit model and reduced-order thermal models generated by using a Krylov subspace projection method.

4. Experimental Validation: Experimental tests are conducted to further validate the proposed thermal modeling method. This involves the use of a programmable dc power supply, an oscilloscope, a function generator, thermocouples, and a data acquisition system to measure the steady-state and transient electrical signals and junction temperature of the SiC MOSFET power module.

These tools collectively enable the development, validation, and comparison of the reduced-order thermal models for SiC MOSFET power modules, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid MOR method.
