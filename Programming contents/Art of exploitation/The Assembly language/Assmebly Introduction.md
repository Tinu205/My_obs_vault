##### General purpose registers

- EAX,EBX,ECX,EDX are known as general purpose registers. These are known as accumulator, base, counter and data registers respectively. They are mainly used as temporary variables in CPU during execution.
##### Other general purpose registers

- ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI are also general purpose registers but they are also referred to as pointers or indices.
- They stands for stack pointer, base pointer, source index and destination index respectively.
- Theses registers are fairly important for program execution and **memory management** .

# The Assembly language

##### Operations:
- mov - moves the value from the source to the destination.
- sub - subtracts the value from the source to destination and stores the value in the destination.
- cmp - this operation is used to compare the values this compare the two values and based on the out  *jle*  or *jmp* command is used.
- jle - jumps to the specified address if the value is less than or equal to the specified value.

##### Commands
There are several commands that can be used to navigate or go through the assembly execution
-  `x or examine` this command can be used to examine the memory to find the current state of the variables. This command takes two arguments when it is used. 
	 - `o` Display in octal
	 - `x` Display in hexadecimal
	 - `y` Display in unsigned, standard base 10 decimal
	 - `t` Display in binary
	 -   when using x/x it shows just one hexadecimal value but when we use x/2x it shows decimal values. This is because when we use x/2x we ask to examine the two consecutive locations of the data.
	 -  The default size of a single unit is 4 byte unit called a word. The valid size letters are :
		 - `b` A single byte
		 - `h` A half-word which is two byte in size.
		 - `w` A word which is four byte in size.
		 - `g` A gaint which is four byte in size.
	
	- The x86 processor values are stored in little-endian byte order, which means the least significant byte is stored first. For example, if four bytes are to be interpreted as a single value, the bytes must be used in reverse order. The GDB debugger is smart enough to know how values are stored, so when a word or half-word is examined, the bytes must be reversed to display the correct values in hexadecimal.
	 
	- A command-line calculator program called bc.
	- `i` can be used to examine the instructins `x/3i` shows the next three instructions.
	- The `c` format letter can be used to automatically look up a byte on the ASCII table, and the s format letter will display an entire string of character data.
		- `x/6cb` or `x/s`
