1. **Classes and Objects:**    
    - **Class:** A blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.
    - **Object:** An instance of a class. Objects have state (attributes) and behaviour (methods).
   
2. [[Encapsulation]]
    - The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in data hiding and protects the integrity of the data.

3. [[Inheritance]]
    - A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviours of an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.
     
4. [[Polymorhism]]
    - The ability of a class to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
     
5. [[Abstraction]]
    
    - Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. Abstraction hides the unnecessary details and highlights the essential features.
     
5. [[Constructors and destructors]] 
     - **Constructor:** A special method that gets called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.
     - **Destructor:** A special method that gets called when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope. It cleans up resources and performs necessary actions.
     
6. [[Method overloading and overriding]]
    
    - **Overloading:** Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.
    - **Overriding:** Providing a specific implementation for a method in a derived class that is already defined in its base class.
8. **Association, Aggregation, and Composition:**
    
    - **Association:** A relationship between two classes, indicating that one class is related to another.
    - **Aggregation:** A special form of association where one class contains another class, but the contained class can exist independently.
    - **Composition:** A stronger form of aggregation where the contained class has no meaning or purpose outside the container class.
9. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes:**
    
    - **Interface:** A collection of abstract methods. Classes can implement interfaces to provide specific implementations.
    - **Abstract Class:** A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. It is meant to be subclassed.
10. **Static and Dynamic Binding:**
    
    - **Static Binding:** The association of a method call to the method body at compile time.
    - **Dynamic Binding:** The association of a method call to the method body at runtime.
11. **Message Passing:**
    
    - Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages. Method calls in OOP can be viewed as messages being sent to objects.
