Encapsulation is one of the four pillars of object oriented programming. Encapsulation can be said as a concept that refers to bundling datum and methods related to a object in a class. It prevents other classes from accessing the data inside a class. Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details while providing the interface to access the data.
It can be done by declaring instance of variable as private and having public getter and setter methods to access and manipulate data.

***Advantages***
- This allows programmers to hide the implementation of a methods to outside class while providing consistent interface to access and modify the data.
- We can make a variable read or write only based on our requirements
- Encapsulated code is easy for unit testing.
