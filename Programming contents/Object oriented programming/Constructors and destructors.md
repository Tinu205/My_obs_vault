In Java, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state. Constructors are essential for setting up an object's initial values and ensuring it is in a valid state. They can be parameterized to accept values during object creation.

The're like `__init__` in python they are initialised once new class_name() is created.

1. **Special Method:**
    - Constructors are special methods in Java.
    - They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type, not even `void`.
    - They are invoked automatically when an object is created using the `new` keyword.
     
2. **Object Initialization:**
    - The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the state of an object.
    - It sets initial values for the object's attributes or fields, ensuring that the object is in a valid state.
     
3. **Initialization of State:**
    - Constructors are essential for initializing an object's state, ensuring that the object starts with meaningful values.

4. **Object Creation:**
    - Constructors are invoked during the creation of an object.
    - When you create an object using the `new` keyword, the appropriate constructor is called to set up the object.
 
5. **Parameterization:**
    - Constructors can be parameterized to accept values during object creation.
    - This allows flexibility in initializing objects with different initial states.
