  
In programming, multiple inheritance refers to a language feature where a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one parent class. This is analogous to a child inheriting traits from both biological parents.

In a multiple inheritance scenario, a class can have multiple parent classes, and it inherits features from all of them. However, multiple inheritance can lead to some challenges, such as the diamond problem. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. This can result in ambiguity if there are conflicting method names or attributes in the common ancestor.

To mitigate the diamond problem, some programming languages, like Java, do not support multiple inheritance for classes. Instead, they allow interfaces, which are similar to abstract classes with only method signatures, to be implemented by a class. In this way, a class can inherit from multiple interfaces.

However, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces. An interface is similar to an abstract class, but it only contains method signatures without any implementation. A class in Java can implement multiple interfaces, effectively achieving a form of multiple inheritance for behaviors.
