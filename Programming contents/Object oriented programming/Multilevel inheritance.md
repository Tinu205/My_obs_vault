In multilevel inheritance, you have a chain of classes where each class serves as both a derived class and a base class. The final derived class inherits from an intermediate class, which in turn inherits from another class, forming a hierarchical structure. In this scenario, the final derived class is indeed a descendant of multiple classes in a hierarchical manner.

Each intermediate class in the hierarchy passes down its properties and behaviors to its derived class. So, in a sense, the final derived class indirectly inherits from the grandparent class.
