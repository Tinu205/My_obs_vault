Polymorphism in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. This is achieved through two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (or static) polymorphism and runtime (or dynamic) polymorphism.

### 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):

**Method Overloading** allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with different parameters (either the number or types of parameters). The compiler determines which method to invoke based on the method signature.

### 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding):

**Method Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to provide its own version of the method.
