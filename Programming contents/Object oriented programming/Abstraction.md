Abstraction in Java is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to model and represent real-world entities by focusing on their essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into more manageable and understandable parts.

In java abstraction can be implemented via 
- **Abstract classes :**  
	 An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract and concrete methods.
- **Abstract methods :** 
	An abstract method is a method declared without an implementation in an abstract class, leaving the implementation to its subclasses.
- **Interfaces :** 
	-  An interface is a collection of abstract methods and, starting from Java 8, can also include default and static methods.
	-  Interfaces allow achieving multiple inheritance as a class can implement multiple interfaces.
