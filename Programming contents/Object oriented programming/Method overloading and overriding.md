***Method overloading***

Think of a butcher working in a hotel kitchen, equipped with a variety of knives tailored for various tasks: skimming, cutting, tearing, and smashing. Despite their different functions, the butcher simplifies by referring to all of them as "knives," selecting each based on the specific task at hand. In programming, method overloading operates similarly.

Within a class, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This allows you to use the same method name for different behaviors or functionalities, depending on the parameters passed to it. 

Method overloading can be achieved through three methods: 
- Changing the parameters 
- Altering the data types 
- Adjusting the order of parameters 
 
By using method overloading, developers can write cleaner, more versatile code that enhances readability, reusability, and flexibility, ultimately improving the overall quality and maintainability of their software.
